# dmenu-lag
dmenu is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for [https://www.suckless.org/dwm](dwm). It manages large numbers of user-defined menu items efficiently.  
This build includes alot of patches to make dmenu more pleasing visually and adds some funcionality to the original software.  
The patches are taken from the suckless.org websites except the alpha patch which was originally made for dwm and I adopted it for dmenu.  
Other patches include more colors, centering, columns, positioning, colored emojis, etc...
